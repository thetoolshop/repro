        If you’re looking to add support for a new top-level component prop to jsxstyle components, you’ve come to the right place.

        We’re looking for props that are either present on a **large number of components** or are present on **frequently-used components** (router components and common HTML elements like links and form controls).

  - type: input
    id: prop-name
    attributes:
      label: Props to add
      placeholder: "example: prop1, prop2"
    validations:
      required: true

  - type: input
    id: component-name
    attributes:
      label: Components that use these props
      description: HTML element names or React/Preact components
      placeholder: "example: li, input, Router from react-router"
    validations:
      required: true

  - type: textarea
    id: additional-context
    attributes:
      label: Additional context

        What’s the use case for the prop/props you’re suggesting?

        Feel free to skip this section if you feel like it’s pretty self-explanatory.
